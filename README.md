# UX

<h2>User stories</h2>

<p>As a fan I expect to see the bands bio and images.</p>
<p>As a potential booker I expect to see a booking form.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>My goal in the design was to make it easy as possible to locate and access information on the site. 
The color scheme was picked to create a nice but simple contrast to give the website a modern feel. </p>


<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>For the fans, I wanted to provide them with an overview of what the band is all about. All the information they need 
is right infront of them, width the option to book for an event if they choose. </p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>In all the sections, I wanted everything to be simple and easy to find. My layout was easy to follow and effective, 
by having a bio for the band, their music, photo's and booking form. </p>


<h2>Skeleton</h2>

<h2>Surface</h2>
<p> The turquoise color scheme was chosen to create a vintage jazz but modern feel.</p>

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>

<p>In the future, I would like to add more music from the band and possibly a band shop to promote them even more.</p>
